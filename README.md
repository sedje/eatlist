# Eatlist app
A simple python app to create a weekly eating list. As every week we seem 
to run into the 'What are we gonna eat next week' discussion, having a tool 
decide that for us is much more convenient.

Very basic yet. Plans are to include some kind of basic sqlite-db with meals 
and their complexity in terms of preparations. Easy meals for work days, more 
complex meals for the weekends. 

Ultimately to also include the meal's ingredients and create a full fledged
shopping list for our own local supermarket including the right order of 
products as they are in the supermarket would be the long term goal.
